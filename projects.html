              I am currently working on a community based eCommerce website.
              Where small businesses can find their potential clients within a
              certain radius. Users will be able to find the type of business
              person they want to work with and read information on them before
              they decide what they want to do.

              I have mentioned before I created a mathematical Problem solver
              that can help High school students do their Mathmatics without
              having to pay for the serivces. The project is ongoing and need
              improvment.

              Created a system on website to help clients with monthly bills and
              shows if they have spent and compares their spending with the past
              months, then gives forcasts of how they likely to spend.
