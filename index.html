      <summary>I created a Fully functional Math Problem Solver</summary>
      <p>
        Front-end: Home page:<br />
        <br />
        The home page will include a brief introduction to the website and its
        purpose. There will be a button to start solving mathematical problems.
        Math problem solving page: On this page, users can insert mathematical
        problems such as power expressions, functions, integration, cos, and
        sign. There will be a scientific calculator to help users input complex
        expressions. Users can also upload images of mathematical problems, and
        the website will scan the image for text and convert it to a readable
        format. Once the problem is entered, the website will give a full
        solution to the problem, including any necessary steps and explanations.
        The page will also show any graphs that are relevant to the problem.
        <br />
        <br />
        Back-end: Image-to-text converter: <br />
        <br />
        The website will use an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) tool to
        convert any uploaded images of mathematical problems into text that can
        be read by the website. Math problem solver: The website will use a math
        problem solver tool to solve the mathematical problems entered by the
        user. The tool will be able to handle power expressions, functions,
        integration, cos, and sign, as well as any other relevant mathematical
        concepts. Graph generator: The website will use a graph generator tool
        to create graphs for any mathematical problems that require them.
