      <h1> About Me</h1>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">I started off as Technical Suppport Specialist right after high School
        I always enjoyed working around computers.<br> That is when I got my first job
        as tutor for a Non Profit Organisation. I saw there that I have passion for 
        working<br> with people and technology and how it was simple for me to break down 
        concepts for the students I was tutoring. <br> The thing about tutoring other is that you also
        get the chance to actually learn about yourself your strengths and<br> weakness.That is when  saw That
        I actually have a lot of patience for people and I am able to explain things much<br> better.

        Later on I had an internet Cafe that I started, coming from a rural area, with no internet 
        connection. It was a great thing.<br> The internet cafe started with two computers in my garage,
        To a point we had twenty computers. It was aimed at helping<br> high school learners with assigments.
        We were getting into an age where School had to learn to do research on the internet.<br> Remember That
        the internet was a new thing to in rural places, but neccessary. Reason being when learners went to 
        Univeristy<br> they would have trouble using computer labs. So My Internet Cafe was aimed at helping learners
        mostly. Ofcouse it carterd to<br> everyone else.<br><br>

     <h3> My Software Engineering Journey</h3>
     <br>
      When Social Media, was starting to take over, the need for software delopment started to grow by then
      I had not caught on. I cannot<br> Remember when, but there was a time when affiliate marketing was also growing
      and that is when I was first introduced to<br>web development and web-design. That is when I wrote my first 
      <code>html</code>code. Although mostly it was the template doing most of the work.<br> I learned to edit them.
      I started to learn about Domain names, links, and backlinks. But in learning to code, my attention shifted
      towards SEO,<br> as it also something that was new. Google keywords, and Optimization was becoming something really
      important. Few years later, I am here<br> back on the path of Software Engineering. My <a href="skills.html">skills</a> page should cover the relvent
      skills thatI have learned in this area.
